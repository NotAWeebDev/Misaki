# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Okami](https://discord.gg/RasxyYT) instead of opening an issue – you will get redirected there anyway.**

**Pull Request** will be shortened to **PR** for simplicity sake.

1. Provide a good title to your PR, it should quickly explain what the Pull is about

   If the Pull Request is for a new command, it's simpler to put "New Command: \<title>" than "Pull Request to add new command".

2. If your PR has fixes or adds a new command please provide either video, or screenshot proof of the working command.

   As well: If the PR fixes a command, please explain what the issue was, and what you did to fix said issue.

3. Use only 1 PR per fixed/new command, this makes it easier to keep a track of different changes.

4. Don't take comments/requested changes from Maintainers personally, we only request specific changes if they impact with the performance or readability of the code.

5. If your PR is a multi-part update, please prefix your PR with "WIP" and please include a check-list of planned additions, and keep it up-to-date in order to ensure the Maintainers as well as the Reviewers can keep up with new code.

6. While this is not a necessary requirement, please title new NSFW commands accordingly, ensure you put "NSFW" in the title of your PR.

   Example being: "NSFW | New Command: \<title>"

7. Follow any advice given by the Maintainers/Reviewers, if there are requested changes not completed (Those that have been granted exception are excluded) the PR will not be merged.

If you wish to contribute to the Misaki codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **correct** branch you want to PR to.
2. Run `npm install`, this will install all required dependancies.
3. Contact a developer / maintainer for the `.env` file, this file is withheld from the general public due to code theft, __**DO NOT SHARE IT**__
